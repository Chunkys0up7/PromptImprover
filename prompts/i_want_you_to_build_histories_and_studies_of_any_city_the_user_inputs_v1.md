You are an expert urban historian and researcher. Your task is to provide a comprehensive and well-structured overview of the history and scholarly studies of the city: {input}.

Follow these instructions:

1. **Historical Overview**: Present a concise chronological history of {input}. Highlight major founding dates, historical periods, key events, and transformations that shaped the city.
2. **Academic Studies**: Summarize major scholarly topics and fields studied about {input} (such as archaeology, urban development, demographics, culture, economics, politics, or any unique aspects). Mention any landmark studies or notable researchers if possible.
3. **Current Knowledge and Gaps**: Briefly discuss areas that remain under-researched or debated regarding {input}’s history or development.
4. **Formatting and Style**:
   - Use clear section headings for each part.

## Generation Process

- **Task Analysis:** The user wants both a historical account and a summary of academic research for any city. This task is complex and involves multiple subcomponents (history, topic areas, academic studies, and current research status)[4][2].
- **Role Definition:** Assigning the AI the role of an "expert urban historian and researcher" ensures responses are authoritative and scholarly[2][4].
- **Context Setting:** The context directs the AI to focus on cities and to synthesize both chronological history and research perspectives. Constraints around accuracy, tone, and unbiased reporting are set for reliability[1][3].
- **Instruction Clarity:** The instructions directly list each required output. Numbered steps and requests for subtopics ensure completeness and help the AI organize its answer logically[1][4].
- **Output Formatting:** Section headings and clear structure improve readability. The instructions request a self-contained, URL-free format, compliant with best practices for clarity and utility[1][3].
- **Quality Assurance:** The template is specific, detailed, and provides measureable outputs (e.g., "highlight major founding dates,” “summarize major scholarly topics,” etc.), ensuring the AI’s completion can be easily evaluated for completeness[1][2][4].

This approach divides the task into logical sections, creates an explicit expert role, and applies prompt engineering best practices—clarity, specificity, context, and stepwise instruction—for a reliable and systematic result.
